## Reconcile

Process what happened since the last session. Read `plans/README.md` and every plan file, then per status:

- **DONE** — spot-check that the done criteria still hold on the current HEAD (cheap ones only). Mark verified in the index. Don't delete plan files — they're the record.
- **BLOCKED** — read the reason. Investigate the underlying obstacle in the codebase. Either rewrite the plan around it (new number if the approach changed fundamentally, in-place refresh otherwise) or mark REJECTED with one line of rationale.
- **IN PROGRESS** (stale) — flag it to the user; an executor probably died mid-run. Check the worktree if one exists.
- **TODO** — run the drift check. If drifted: re-verify the finding still exists (it may have been fixed in passing), then refresh the "Current state" excerpts and `Planned at` SHA. If the finding is gone, mark REJECTED ("fixed independently").

Finish with a short report: what's verified done, what was refreshed, what's rejected, and what's executable right now.
